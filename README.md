# Pandoc for AWS Lambda

This is a precompiled version of [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) for the Amazon Linux machine image used by AWS Lambda, deployable as an AWS lambda layer. It can help you get started quickly with Pandoc inside Lambda functions.

## Use within Lambda

You can use a pre-deployed `ARN: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:818931230230:layer:pandoc:6` or deploy yourself -- edit Makefile to set your deployment bucket etc, then just run `make deploy`.

The binary will be in `/opt/bin/pandoc` inside your Lambda container.

## Build it yourself

Check out the [Running Pandoc on Lambda Guide](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/pandoc-lambda.html) for information on how this binary was produced, and how to compile a different version yourself with modified options.
